## Description
This repository contains the solutions for ADM-HW5. Here's an overview of the contents:

- **main.ipynb:** This notebook includes all the answers to the homework questions.
- **libs** This folder contains all the functions used in Q2.
- **CommandLine.sh** This file contains the commands for the Command Line Question (CLQ)

## Important notes
We used the library IPyWidgets for the frontend part (visualizations). Since both github and nbviewer donâ€™t show the widgets outputs, an html version of the notebook is accessible at this link (made with GitHub Pages): https://ambarchatterjee.github.io/ADM_HW5_Group21/
