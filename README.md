## Description
This repository contains the solutions for ADM-HW5, where it was requested to deal with graphs. Here's an overview of the contents:

- **main.ipynb:** This notebook includes all the answers to the homework questions.
- **libs** This folder contains all the functions used in Q2 in two separate files (*backend.py* and *frontend.py*).
- **CommandLine.sh** This file contains the commands for the Command Line Question (CLQ).
- **citation_graph.graphml** This file contains the citation graph in *.graphml* format (lightweight), in case the user wants to interact with the widgets.
- **collaboration_graph.graphml** This file contains the collaboration graph in *.graphml* format (lightweight), in case the user wants to interact with the widgets.
- **subgraph_collaboration_graph.graphml** This file contains the largest component of the collaboration graph in *.graphml* format (lightweight), in case the user wants to interact with the widgets.

## Important notes
The library IPyWidgets was used for the frontend part (visualizations). Since both github and nbviewer donâ€™t show the widgets outputs, an html version of the notebook is accessible at [this](https://ambarchatterjee.github.io/ADM_HW5_Group21) link (made with GitHub Pages).  
Alternatively, you can download the notebook and the graphs in *.graphml* format and run the code on your local machine. This makes possible to use the interactive widgets, since only the static output is displayed in the above link.
